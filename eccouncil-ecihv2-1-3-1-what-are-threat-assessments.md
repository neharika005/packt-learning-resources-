Threat Assessment

What is a Threat Assessment?

The process of examining, filtering, transforming, and modeling of acquired
threat data for extracting threat intelligence.

It is a process where the knowledge of internal and external threat information
or vulnerabilities pertinent to a particular organization is matched to
real-world attacks.

It enables the organization to predict, combat, and prevent possible threats to
the organization.

Threat assessment allows the organizations to assess their current threat
landscape by identifying flaws in their assets, the chances for exploitation
using those flaws, and their origin.

Performing regular threat assessment to its infrastructure can allow an
organization to protect its assets from evolving cyber threats.


What is Threat intelligence?

The collection and analysis of information about threats and adversaries and
drawing patterns that provide an ability to make knowledgeable decisions for
the preparedness, prevention, and response actions against various cyberattacks.


Helps an organization to identify and mitigate various business risks by
converting unknown threats into known threats as well as focusing efforts on
implementing various advanced and proactive defense strategies.


What is Threat contextualization?

The process of assessing the threats and their impacts in various conditions.


What is Threat correlation?

The process used by organizations to monitor, detect, and escalate various
evolving threats from the organizational networks.

The main objective behind threat correlation is to reduce the false-positive
alert rates and detect and escalate stealthy, complex attacks.

Threat correlation benefits the incident response teams, by helping them to
focus on priority issues, reducing potential risk and corporate liabilities.


Commonly used correlation techniques:

	▪ Relating multiple incident types and sources across multiple nodes
	▪ Incident sequence
	▪ Incident persistence
	▪ Incident-directed data collection


What is Threat attribution?

The process of identifying the actors behind an attack, their goals and motives
along with the sponsors, as well as analyzing the threats to identify the
indicators of compromise (IoCs) and derive useful threat intelligence.
