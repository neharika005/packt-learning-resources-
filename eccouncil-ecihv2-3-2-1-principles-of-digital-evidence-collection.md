Principles of Digital Evidence Collection

What is Digital Evidence? -

Digital evidence is defined as “any information of probative value that is either
stored or transmitted in a digital form”

Digital evidence may be present across computing devices, servers, routers, and
so on. It is revealed during the forensics investigation while examining storage
media, monitoring network traffic, or making duplicate copies of digital data.


What are the types of Digital Evidence? -

	▪ Volatile - refers to the temporary information on a device that requires a
	constant power supply and is deleted if the power supply is interrupted.

	▪ Non-Volatile - refers to the permanent data stored on secondary storage
	devices, such as hard disks and memory cards. Nonvolatile data does not depend
	on power supply and remains intact even when the device is switched off.


What are the characteristics of Digital Evidence? -

The main characteristic of digital evidence is its relevance and weight
(influence).

The term “relevance” refers to the connection between digital evidence and the
fact(s) that is/are to be proved.

The term “weight" refers to how much the digital evidence changes the
probability of the fact.


ALL EVIDENCE MUST BE:

	▪ Admissible - related to the fact being proved
	▪ Authentic - real and related to the incident in a proper way
	▪ Complete - prove guilt or innocence
	▪ Reliable - no doubt about the authenticity or veracity of the evidence
	▪ Believable - clear and understandable


What are the different types of evidence that incident responders may have to
deal with?

	▪ Host based
	▪ Network based
	▪ Other


What are the ACPO Principles of Digital Evidence? -

▪ Principle 1 - No action taken by law enforcement agencies or their agents
should change data held on a computer or storage media, which may subsequently
be relied upon in court.

▪ Principle 2 - In exceptional circumstances, where a person finds it necessary
to access original data held on a computer or on storage media, that person must
be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and
the implications of their actions.

▪ Principle 3 - An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to
computer-based electronic evidence should be created and preserved. An
independent third party should be able to examine those processes and achieve the
same result.

▪ Principle 4 - The person in charge of the investigation (the case officer)
has overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are
adhered to.


What are the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) Principles,
Standards & Criteria? -

Principle 1: In order to ensure that the digital evidence is collected,
preserved, examined, or transferred in a manner safeguarding the accuracy and
reliability of the evidence, law enforcement and forensic organizations must
establish and maintain an effective quality system

Standards and Criteria 1.1: All agencies that seize and/or examine digital
evidence must maintain an appropriate SOP document. All elements of an agency's
policies and procedures concerning digital evidence must be clearly set forth in
this SOP document, which must be issued under the agency's management authority

Standards and Criteria 1.2: Agency management must review the SOPs on an annual
basis to ensure their continued suitability and effectiveness

Standards and Criteria 1.3: Procedures used must be generally accepted in the
field or supported by data gathered and recorded in a scientific manner

Standards and Criteria 1.4: The agency must maintain written copies of
appropriate technical procedures

Standards and Criteria 1.5:The agency must use hardware and software that is
appropriate and effective for the seizure or examination procedure

Standards and Criteria 1.6: All activities relating to the seizure, storage,
examination, or transfer of the digital evidence must be recorded in writing and
be available for review and testimony

Standards and Criteria 1.7: Any action that has the potential to alter, damage,
or destroy any aspect of the original evidence must be performed by qualified
persons in a forensically sound manner


What does the Incident Responder have to know about collecting Physical
Evidence? -

Physical evidence includes:

	▪ Removable media
	▪ Cables
	▪ Publications
	▪ All computer equipment, including peripherals
	▪ Items taken from the trash
	▪ Miscellaneous items


Tag all the objects identified as evidence, and mention all the required details
on the tag, such as the time, date, incident responder’s name, and control number.



First responders must perform the following steps while collecting evidence from
Powered On computers:

	▪ If a computer is switched ON and the screen is viewable, photograph the
	screen and document the running programs

	▪ If a portable computer wakes up, record the time and date at which this
	occurs, take a photograph of the screen, and provide a brief explanation of
	all the programs running

	▪ If a computer is ON and the monitor shows a screensaver, move the mouse
	slowly without pressing any mouse buttons and then photograph and document
	the programs

	▪ After collection of all the volatile data, turn off the devices

	▪ For portable computers, press down the power switch for 30 seconds to force
	the power off, then remove the battery and unplug the power cord from the
	power outlet

	▪ If the computer is switched OFF, leave it in that state



First responders must perform the following steps while collecting evidence
from Powered Off computers:

▪ If it is switched OFF, leave it OFF


If a monitor is switched OFF and the display is blank:

▪ Turn the monitor ON, move the mouse slightly, observe the changes from a
blank screen to another screen, and note the changes

▪ Photograph the screen


If a monitor is switched ON and the display is blank:

▪ Move the mouse slightly

▪ If the screen does not change on moving the mouse slightly, do not press any
keys

▪ Photograph the screen



First responders must perform the following steps while collecting evidence from
network connected computers:

▪ Unplug the network cable(s) from the router and/or modem in order to prevent
further attacks

▪ Photograph ALL devices connected to the victim’s computer from several angles

▪ If any devices, such as a printer or scanner, are present near the computer,
take photographs of those devices as well

▪ If the computer is turned OFF, leave it in that state, and if it is ON,
photograph the screen and follow the steps for powered on computers

▪ Unplug all cords and devices connected to the computer and label them for
identification



First responders must perform the following steps while collecting evidence
about open files and startup files:

▪ Open any recently created documents from the startup or system32 folder in
Windows and the rc.local file in Linux

▪ Document the date and time of the files

▪ Examine the open files for sensitive data such as passwords or images

▪ Search for unusual modified, accessed, or changed times on vital folders, and
startup files

▪ Use the dir command for Windows or the ls command for Linux to locate the
actual access times on those files and folders


What is Chain of Custody? -

The Chain of custody demonstrates the progression of evidence as it travels from
the original evidence location to the forensic laboratory.

The chain of custody covers the collection, handling, storage, testing, and
disposition of evidence.

Chain of custody documentation should list all the people involved in the
collection and preservation of evidence and their actions.

The Chain of custody document should contain complete information about the
obtained evidence, such as:

	▪ Case number
	▪ Information about the individual releasing or forwarding the evidence item
	to inquiry personnel
	▪ Complete address and telephone number of the individuals who handled the
	electronic evidence
	▪ Location from where the evidence was obtained
	▪ Date/time of evidence acquisition
	▪ Item number/quantity/ description of items


What about the Evidence Bag Contents List? -

The panel on the front of evidence bags must, at the very least, contain the
following details:

	▪ Date and time of seizure
	▪ Incident responder who seized the evidence
	▪ Exhibit number
	▪ Where the evidence was seized from
	▪ Details of the contents of the evidence bag
	▪ Submitting agency and its address


NOTE: Additional details required on the panel of the evidence bags include
name of the officers who took photographs or prepared a scene sketch, sites
where individual items were found, and names of the suspects, if any.


What about Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Electronic Evidence? -

First responders must package, store, and transport all the physical evidence
for further analysis after collecting all the volatile information. They must
perform the following:

	▪ Label all the devices and their components and create a list
	▪ Avoid turning computers upside down or putting them on their side during
	transport
	▪ Keep the electronic evidence away from magnetic sources such as radio
	transmitters, speaker magnets, and heated seats
	▪ Store the evidence away from extreme heat, cold, or moisture
	▪ Avoid storing electronic evidence in vehicles for a long period of time
	▪ Maintain proper chain of custody of the transported evidence
	▪ Ensure that wireless devices do not connect to any networks by storing them
	in signal blocking containers
