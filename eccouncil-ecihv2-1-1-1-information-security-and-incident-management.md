## Information Security and Incident Management


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand what basic information security concepts are and why they are
important.

Explain the basic concepts of confidentiality, integrity, availability,
authenticity, and non-repudiation.

Identify the reasons why an organization needs to implement and use information
security policies.

Define what common information security threats and attack vectors organizations
should be aware of.

Information Security Concepts

Information security refers to the protection or safeguarding of information and
information systems that use, store, and transmit information from unauthorized
accesses, disclosures, alterations, and destruction.

It relies on five major elements: confidentiality, integrity, availability,
authenticity, and non-repudiation.


1. Confidentiality - "Keeping good data away from bad actors"

For Confidentiality to be maintained in a network, data must be protected at
rest, in use and on the wire.

Violations of Confidentiality can come from ANYWHERE, at ANY TIME... bad
decisions on the part of users, administrators and customers can all lead to a
violation. Also, remember that security policies that are not implemented
properly can lead to potential confidentiality violations.

Possible countermeasures include:

	a. encryption
	b. traffic padding
	c. strict access controls / authentication
	d. data classification
	e. awareness training


Confidentiality & Integrity depend on each other. One is not effective without
the other.

Additional concepts linked to Confidentiality:

	1. sensitivity
	2. discretion
	3. criticality
	4. concealment
	5. isolation


2. Integrity - "Change control for data - no unauthorized modification without
knowledge and consent of data owner"

Three ways in which we can understand Integrity:

	1. Preventing unauthorized subjects from making modifications
	2. Preventing authorized subjects from making unauthorized
modifications
	3. Maintaining consistency of objects so that they are true and accurate

Possible countermeasures include:

	a. strict access controls / authentication
	b. IDS
	c. encryption
	d. hashing
	e. interface restrictions / controls
	f. input / function checks (validation)


Additional concepts linked to Integrity:

	1. accuracy
	2. authenticity
	3. validity
	4. nonrepudiation - user cannot deny having performed an action


3. Availability - authorized subjects can access objects in a timely manner
without interruption

Possible countermeasures include:

	a. strict access controls / authentication
	b. continuous monitoring
	c. firewalls & routers to prevent DoS / DDoS attacks
	d. redundant system design
	e. periodic testing of backup systems


Additional concepts linked to Availability:

	1. usability
	2. accessibility
	3. timeliness


4. Authenticity - the characteristic of a communication, document, or any data
that ensures it is genuine.


5. Non-Repudiation - a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot
later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having
received the message. Individuals and organizations use digital signatures to
ensure non-repudiation.

NOTE: Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are together referred to as
the CIA triad.


• Information as a business asset

• Defense in depth

• Information Security Policies -

Define the basic security requirements and rules to be implemented in order to
protect and secure an organization’s information systems.

Should help to answer 2 questions:

	1. WHY are we doing this?
	2. WHAT are we doing?

Policies are not technology specific and accomplish three things:

▪ They reduce or eliminate legal liability of employees and third parties.

▪ They protect confidential and proprietary information from theft, misuse,
unauthorized disclosure, or modification.

▪ They prevent wastage of the company’s resources.

There are 2 types of policies:

	1. Technical - configuration
	2. Administrative - behavior


Who is involved in the implementation of the policies?:

▪ Director of Information Security
▪ Chief Security Officer


What are the types of security policies?

	• Promiscuous Policy - No restrictions on usage of system resources

	• Permissive Policy - Policy begins wide open and only known dangerous
	services/attacks or behaviors are blocked -- It should be updated regularly to
	be effective

	• Prudent Policy - It provides maximum security while allowing known but
	necessary dangers -- It blocks all services and only safe/ necessary services
	are enabled individually; everything is logged

	• Paranoid Policy - It forbids everything, no internet connection, or severely
	limited internet usage


  Information Security Threats and Attack Vectors

  What makes an attack?

  	Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability

  What are some attack vectors?

  	Cloud computing
  	Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
  	Viruses & Worms
  	Ransomware
  	Insider Attacks
  	Web Applications
  	IoT


  What are the broad information security threat categories?

  	1. Network
  	2. Host
  	3. Application


  Threats and Threat Actors -

  	Threats are “[t]he potential for a person or thing to exercise (accidentally
		trigger or intentionally exploit) a specific vulnerability.”

  	Threat actors are the bad actors that exploit threats to cause harm.


  What is the impact of information security attacks?

  	Financial Losses
  	Loss of C I A
  	Reputational Damage
  	Legal and Regulatory concerns


  Information warfare - Defense vs Offense

  What are Information Security Incidents?

  Incidents are events that have negative outcomes or consequences in relation
	to C I A for one or more assets within the enterprise.

  	Unauthorized Access
  	Insider Threat
  	Unauthorized usage of services
