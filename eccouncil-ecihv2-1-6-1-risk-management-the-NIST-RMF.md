## Risk Management - The NIST RMF


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand what the NIST Risk Management Framework is.

Explain the importance of the NIST Risk Management Framework for an organization
that wants to manage risk.

Identify the phases of the NIST Risk Management Framework.

Define what key action(s) should be taken in each phase of the NIST Risk
Management Framework.

Risk Management - The Basics

What is the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)? -

A structured and continuous process that integrates information security and
risk management activities into the system development life cycle (SDLC).

It follows a security life cycle, which involves six stages:

	▪ Categorization of the Information System - the initial stage, which involves
	defining criticality or sensitivity of the information system according to the
	potential worst-case scenario. This shows the adverse impact to the mission or
	the business.

	▪ Selection of the Security Controls - Categorize the information system, and
	then select the baseline security controls under a NIST risk management
	framework. Apply tailored guidance and supplemental controls (if needed) based
	on risk assessment.

	▪ Implement the Security Controls - Implement security controls within the
	enterprise architecture using sound system-engineering practices. Apply
	security configuration settings.

	▪ Assess the Security Controls - Determine security control effectiveness by
	ensuring correct and effective implementation of the controls as per required
	operation and compliance with security requirements for the information system.

	▪ Authorize the Information System - Determine risk to organizational
	operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the nation; if
	acceptable, authorize the operation.

	▪ Monitor Security State - Continuously track changes to the information
	system that may affect security controls, and reassess control effectiveness.
