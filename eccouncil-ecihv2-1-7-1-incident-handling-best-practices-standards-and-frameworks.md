Understanding Incident Response Automation and Orchestration -

Incident response automation is the process of superseding manual IR actions
with automatic IR actions using machines and tools.

NOTE: Automation helps with efficient handling and response to security
incidents by sending timely notification about the incidents across the
organization.


The automation of IR process assists in performing the following actions:

▪ Helps in investigating incidents by providing data from different sources,
 for example, past incidents information, threat intelligence, and SIEM.

▪ Provides functionality allowing responders to give instructions and change the
configuration of various security controls.

▪ Reducing the time taken for analyzing the incidents and responding to them
efficiently.

▪ Enables responders to pay more attention to the alerts generated by critical
incidents rather than checking every alert and prioritizing them in order to
respond to the most critical ones.


Incident response orchestration combines the abilities of the incident response
team, tools, and processes to respond and handle information security incidents
efficiently


What is the difference between automation and orchestration?

IR automation converts the manual process into an automated process based on the
preset instruction from the responders.

IR orchestration involves combining automation with machine and human
intelligence to build an environment that learns and evolves with changing
situations.


Incident Handling and Response Best Practices - best practices provided by
OWASP, ENISA, and GPG18 and Forensic readiness planning (SPF)


1. OWASP -

Audit and Due Diligence

Create a Response Team - Document the roles and responsibilities of the team
members and communicate this clearly to all relevant stakeholders

Create a Documented Incident Response Plan - at a minimum should cover roles and
responsibilities, investigation, triage and mitigation, recovery, and documentation process.


Identify All Triggers and Indicators

Investigate the Problem - A thorough investigation will require input from the
incident response team and might require input from external resources. The
investigation will document the incident details, including what to look for,
who to involve, and how to document what is found.


Triage and Mitigation - the triage process should include the following activities:

	o Classification of the incident
	o Incident prioritization
	o Assigning specific tasks to specific people


Recovery - the transition from active incident to standard monitoring. The
recovery procedure should include the steps for transition given the specifics
of the organization’s environment and approach.


Documentation and Reporting - critical actions that will always occur before,
during, and after incident response.


Process Review - Can help the organization to answer the following:

	o Should the organization increase or decrease the number of incident handlers?

	o Whether the organization should develop automated procedures for incident
	handling?

	o What risks did the organization identify during the incident that need to be
	followed up for action and monitored closely?


Practice - It is important that the incident response team understand how
important mock drills and practice are to the organization.


2. ENISA -

Workflow - Organize periodic (for example, twice a year) workshops to develop
and review a common incident handling workflow.

Incident Handling Process - Organizations should start with the simple model
and then, as the team becomes more experienced, develop the procedure further.

Legal Officer - Train one or a few team members in the most important legal
aspects related to incident activities.

Incident Report -

	o Use network monitoring systems (for example, intrusion detection systems or
		any other threat monitoring systems) to actively look for incidents in
		organizational network

	o Subscribe to services which provide information about compromised machines

	o Monitor blacklists for records from the location where the organization
	operates


Incident Verification


Final Classification ( classify incidents according to what is ) -

	o reported by incident reporters
	o recognized by incident handlers at the very beginning of the incident
	handling process


Policies - a quality review process should be in place. The feedback on policies
is then used and incorporated into the existing policies to make sure these
policies are up to date.


Entry and Exit Procedures - Exit procedures should always be followed without
question. The exit procedures should aim at the following:

	o Removing access to systems with confidential information (changing
		password, revoking certificates and keys, blocking accounts, and so on.)

	o Logging the actions of the employee leaving

	o Backing up all work

	o Revoking their roles in incident management

	o Interviewing to hand over to the next person

	o Performing an exit interview to learn for the future

	o Announcing staff change to constituents, parent organization, and other teams


Eradication and Recovery


3. GPG18 and Forensic readiness planning (SPF) -

There are 12 significant principles that organizations should observe as part
of adoption of forensic readiness policy, which are as follows:

Principle 1 - Organizations must develop and implement a forensic readiness
policy.

Principle 2 - Forensic readiness policy should be owned at a director level
within an organization.

Principle 3 - Organizations should have a recognized and consistent point of
contact for establishing and maintaining relationships during planning and
exercises, and to act as a focal point during investigations or crisis
management. The point of contact should work closely with organizations’ legal
department and other relevant stakeholders during every stage of each
investigation.

Principle 4 - Forensic readiness policy requirements and the supporting
capability should be defined with regard to the level of information risk or
actual business needs to undertake digital forensic investigations.

Principle 5 - Organizations should adopt a scenario-based forensic readiness
planning approach that learns from experience.

Principle 6 - Organizations should closely integrate forensic readiness plans
with incident management and other related business planning activities.

Principle 7 - Investigations should seek to produce the best standard of
digital forensic evidence. Practitioners should adopt the principles published
by Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).

Principle 8 - Any internal or external digital forensic capability employed by
an organization should apply formal quality assurance processes, and all staff
involved in handling evidence during investigations should have an appropriate
degree of competence.

Principle 9 - Organizations should maintain the quality and effectiveness of
their records management systems in order that specific business records can be
produced as evidence in court or to address any legal or regulatory requirement.

Principle 10 - Organizations should provide appropriate records retrieval
processes and mechanisms in order that any requirement to disclose information
can be efficiently and securely dealt with. Such disclosures must be handled in
accordance with all relevant legislation and regulations.

Principle 11 - An open and collaborative approach should be adopted within
organizations, wherever possible, to gain acceptance of methods used to support
investigations and incident handling. All methods of investigation and detection
of information security incidents must be lawful.

Principle 12 - Organizations should have a management review process that
improves plans in accordance with experience and new knowledge.


Standards -

COBIT emphasizes regulatory compliance, helping organizations increase the
value attained from IT, enables alignment, and simplifies the implementation of
the enterprise’s IT governance and control framework.

The COBIT Framework is based on five key principles for the governance and
management of enterprise IT that include:

	▪ Meeting stakeholder needs
	▪ Covering the enterprise end-to-end
	▪ Applying a single integrated framework
	▪ Enabling a holistic approach
	▪ Separating governance from management

NIST SP 800-61 - Step-by-step instructions for new, or well-established,
incident response teams to create a proper policy and plan.


NIST recommends that each plan should have a mission statement, strategies and
goals, an organizational approach to incident response, metrics for measuring
the response capability, and a built-in process for updating the plan as needed.

It includes the lifecycle for the incident handling and response that contains
different phases such as:

	▪ Preparation
	▪ Detection and Analysis
	▪ Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
	▪ Post-Incident Activity
