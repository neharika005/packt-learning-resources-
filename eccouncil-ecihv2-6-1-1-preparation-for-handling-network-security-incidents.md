## Preparation for Handling Network Security Incidents


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand why network Incident Handling is important for IH&R team members.

Explain what are the preparation steps or guidelines that should be followed by
incident handlers for network incidents.

Identify common network security incidents that IH&R team members should be
aware of.

Preparation for Handling Network Security Incidents

Why is Network Incident Handling important? -

Organizations require a proper network IH&R process in order to detect and
contain network attacks as early as possible to minimize data losses and
maintain business continuity.

In addition, the network IH&R process will help organizations to develop threat
intelligence, and build an incident response team equipped with the proper tools
to address ongoing threats.


Common network security incidents may include:

	▪ Unauthorized Access
	▪ Inappropriate Usage
	▪ Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
	▪ Wireless Networks


What are the preparation steps or guidelines that are followed by incident
handlers for network incidents? -

	▪ Communicate the goals of IH&R processes to ALL members of the organization.

	▪ Configure network perimeter control devices such as firewalls, IDS, and IPS
	systems to log all the access attempts and send notifications regarding the
	attempts of intrusion to the administrator or incident response team.

	▪ Implement Syslog or any other centralized logging mechanism to backup logs
	from all the network security devices to a single location. This will help in
	analysis and correlation of logs.

	▪ Clearly define the roles and responsibility of all the users,
	administrators, and IH&R team personnel during the incident response process
	in maintaining secure access to network infrastructure.

	▪ Implement standard network usage protocols

	▪ Provide all the IH&R team members necessary training and conduct practice
	sessions to verify the team’s efficiency.

	▪ Backup all important servers and keep them accessible.

	▪ Contact Internet service providers (ISPs) and their second-tier agents to
	gather information about the incident handling and response processes for the
	network incidents happening at their end.

	▪ Gather the contact details of national and government security
	organizations, such as CERT and Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) to seek
	help in case of attacks that impact national security.

	▪ Define proper data collection and accumulation strategies and define the
	types of data to be collected while performing network forensic analysis.

	▪ Define live analysis laboratory configurations and determine host hardening
	and sandbox environments.

	▪ Identify the type of capture required (e.g., limited capture, full packet
		capture) while performing network data capturing.

	▪ Determine appropriate capture device deployment location and ensure the
	integrity and security of the network after introduction of a capture device.
