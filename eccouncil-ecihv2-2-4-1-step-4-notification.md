Step 4 Notification

What is the process flow for notification? -

Communication plays a major role in swiftly responding to an incident. It helps
in reducing the impact of an incident by facilitating better coordination
between different stakeholders.

Incident handlers must communicate the severity of an incident to management
in order to secure approval for performing incident response procedures.

Communications should include the initial processes performed to assess the
situation, detection methods applied, impacted resources, and management strategy.

NOTE: The IH&R team may need to discuss the incident with the organization's
legal representative to file a lawsuit against the perpetrators, if necessary.

Incident handlers may also need to communicate with an external party after
approvals from management if they need external support for handling the incident.

After controlling and mitigating the incident, the incident response team can
disseminate the details of the incident and lessons learned throughout the
organization to create/raise awareness.


Who ya' gonna call? -

The IH&R team should have a list of contacts who have a role to play in the
incident response process.

They must notify all these contacts after classifying and prioritizing the
incident to gain permission and perform other incident response functions as
needed.


What are you gonna tell 'em ? -

The IH&R team should communicate the following details about the incident, as
they will help with containment and eradication:

	▪ Impact on business and services
	▪ Scope of attack including the resources, accounts, devices, and other
	components compromised
	▪ Information /data at risk
	▪ Level of incident severity
	▪ Urgency for recovery
	▪ Resources available
	▪ (Exact) time of detection for incident activity
	▪ Network location of the activity
	▪ Attack vectors and source(s)
	▪ Vulnerabilities or configuration flaws exploited
	▪ Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
	▪ Methods used for detection
	▪ Suggestions regarding containment and eradication


How are you gonna tell 'em? -

During the incident response process secure communication between different
teams is essential.

	▪ Secure Communication Channels
	▪ Out-of-Band Communication Channels
