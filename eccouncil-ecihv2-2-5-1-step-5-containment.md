Step 5 Containment

What is Incident Containment? -

The IH&R team plays a significant role in this stage by taking actions that
reduce a threat or incident’s magnitude or complexity to prevent further damage
to the organization.

Some of the key activities of an IH&R team in containing a security incident are:

	▪ The IH&R team in partnership with the technical and management personnel
  must create a containment strategy.

	▪ The strategy should incorporate feedback from external sources if required.

	▪ The IH&R team should validate the type of response(s) required to contain
  the incident and then assigns the task(s) to the technical, management, or
  legal teams as appropriate.

	▪ Once the relevant team(s) have completed their assigned task(s), the IH&R
  team must validate that containment was successful.

	▪ If incident containment failed, then the IH&R team must escalate the
  process, review and update the containment strategy, and engage with the
  necessary resources to seek successful containment.
