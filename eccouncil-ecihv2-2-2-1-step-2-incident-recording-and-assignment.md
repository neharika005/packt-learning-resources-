Step 2: Incident Recording and Assignment

Define Incident Escalation Procedures for Employees -

The incident handling and response process should define a proper incident
escalation plan or procedure.


The plan should:

	▪ Allow victims, customers, clients, and other people to report an incident
	easily

	▪ Enable the incident handler to assign tasks to team members, verify the
	process, and obtain reports about the progress

	▪ Allow the incident responders to discuss the steps, communicate the response
results, and provide result data with proper evidence

	▪ Communicate results and report to management and stakeholders

NOTE: The escalation plan depends on the organization type, size, and types of
attacks it might face


Role of IT Support and / or the Help Desk -

IT support receives a call from users regarding issues with systems, network,
applications, etc...

IT support will record the call and try to identify the issue using a
questionnaire based on the type of incident

If IT support suspects the issues to be a security incident, then they will
assign it to the IH&R team using a ticketing system


What is a Ticketing System?

Simplifies incident response and handling process by tracking details of
incidents in a centralized location easily accessible by ALL IH&R team members

Organizations MUST USE the ticketing system to keep track of all the incident
response activities


What are the Advantages of using ticketing systems?

	▪ Can generate tickets automatically on discovering suspicious patterns from
firewall, IDS, and SIEM, etc…

	▪ Systematically collects details about the incident

	▪ Helps in assigning priority to incidents based on the compromised system,
	type of incident, etc...

	▪ Alerts the responsible person(s) and distributes tasks automatically

	▪ Stores details of the incidents, solutions, and results
