## Cloud Computing Concepts


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand what the defining Cloud Computing concepts are.

Explain what the three accepted types of Cloud Computing Services are.

Identify what the separation of responsibilities is between the customer and
the provider in Cloud Computing.

Define the four Cloud Deployment Models used in Cloud Computing.

Identify the roles/actors defined by the NIST Cloud Reference Architecture.

	▪ Virtualization technology


What are the three accepted types of Cloud Computing Services?

	Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) - The capability provided to the consumer
	is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing
	resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software,
	which can include operating systems and applications.

The consumer DOES NOT manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but
has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and
possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).


	Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) - The capability provided to the consumer is to
	deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications
	created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported
	by the provider.

The consumer DOES NOT manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over
the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the
application-hosting environment.


	Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) - The capability provided to the consumer is to
	use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The
	applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin
	client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program
	interface.

The consumer DOES NOT manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual
application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user specific
application configuration settings.

What are the Cloud Deployment Models?

	Private - The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a
	single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It
	may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some
	combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

	Public -  The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general
	public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or
	government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises
	of the cloud provider.

	Hybrid - The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct
	cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique
	entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that
	enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load
	balancing between clouds).

	Community - The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a
	specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns
	(e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations).
	It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in
	the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on
	or off premises.


What are the roles/actors defined by the NIST Cloud Reference Architecture?

(Special Publication 500-292)

Cloud Consumer - A person or organization that uses cloud computing services

Cloud Provider - A person or organization providing services to interested
parties

Cloud Carrier - An intermediary for providing connectivity and transport
services between cloud consumers and providers

Cloud Auditor - A party for making independent assessments of cloud service
controls and taking an opinion thereon

Cloud Broker - An entity to manage cloud services in terms of use, performance,
and delivery who also maintains relationship between cloud providers and consumers


Cloud brokers provide services in three categories:

	o Service Intermediation - Improves a given function by a specific capability
	and provides value-added services to cloud customers

	o Service Aggregation - Combines and integrates multiple services into one or
	more new services

	o Service Arbitrage - the services being aggregated are not fixed (cloud
		broker has the flexibility to choose services from multiple agencies)
