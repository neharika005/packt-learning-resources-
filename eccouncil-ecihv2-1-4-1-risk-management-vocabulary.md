Risk Management - The Basics

What Is Risk?

MUST KNOW CONCEPTS !!: NIST SP800-30R1 page 12

Risk: The probability (likelihood) that a given threat source will exercise a
particular vulnerability and the resulting impact should that occur

Threat -  an event or situation that if it occurred, would prevent the
organization from operating in its normal manner

Vulnerability - weakness

Likelihood - chance something might happen

Impact - what a threat will cost (quantitative/qualitative)

Countermeasure (control) - mechanism applied to minimize risk

Residual Risk - remaining risk(s) after all countermeasures/controls have been
applied

Risk = Threat * Vulnerability
