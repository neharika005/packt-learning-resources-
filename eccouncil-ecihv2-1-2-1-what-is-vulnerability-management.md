Vulnerability Management

What is a Vulnerability? -

the existence of a weakness, design, or an implementation error that, when
exploited, leads to an unexpected and undesirable event compromising the
security of the system.


What are some common Vulnerability Research Websites? -

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) (https://nvd.nist.gov)

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a published standard that
provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of
IT vulnerabilities.

CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability
and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity. The numerical score can
then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high,
and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their
vulnerability management processes.

 ▪ National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (https://nvd.nist.gov)


Are there Vulnerability Classifications?: (9)

	▪ Misconfigurations - the most common vulnerability that is mainly caused by
	human error, which allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

	▪ Default Installations - Not changing default settings on software or
	hardware makes it much more likely that the attacker will be able to guess the
	settings in order to break into the systems.

	▪ Buffer Overflows - attackers try to take control of the system by writing
	content beyond the allocated size of the buffer. Insufficient bounds checking
	in the program is the root cause. Systems often crash or become unstable when
	buffer overflow occurs.

	▪ Unpatched Servers - These unpatched servers act as an entry point into the
	network. This can lead to exposure of private data, financial loss,
	discontinuation of operations, and so on.

	▪ Design Flaws - Design vulnerabilities such as incorrect encryption or poor
	validation of data refer to logical flaws in the functionality of the system
	that are exploited by the attackers to bypass the detection mechanism and
	acquire access to a secure system.

	▪ Operating System Flaws - Patching of the OS, installing the minimum software
	applications necessary, and the use of applications with firewall capabilities
	are essential steps that an administrator needs to take to protect the OS from
	attack.

	▪ Application Flaws - Applications pose security threats such as data
	tampering and unauthorized access to configuration stores. It is important for
	developers to understand the anatomy of common security vulnerabilities and
	develop highly secure applications by providing proper user validation and
	authorization.

	▪ Open Services - Open ports and services may lead to loss of data, DoS
	attacks, and allow attackers to perform further attacks on other connected
	devices. Administrators need to continuously check for unnecessary or insecure
	ports and services to reduce the risk on the network.

	▪ Default Passwords - make devices and systems vulnerable to various attacks
	such as brute-force and dictionary attack. Passwords should be kept secret;
	failing to protect the confidentiality of a password allows the system to be
	compromised with ease.


What is a Vulnerability Assessment?

An examination of the ability of a system or application, including current
security procedures and controls, to withstand assault. It seeks to identify,
measure, and classify security vulnerabilities in a computer system, network,
and communication channels.

A vulnerability assessment may be used to:

	▪ Identify weaknesses that could be exploited
	▪ Predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in protecting
	information resources from attack


Types of Vulnerability Assessments: (8)

	▪ Active
	▪ Passive
	▪ External
	▪ Internal
	▪ Host-Based
	▪ Network
	▪ Application
	▪ Wireless


What is the Vulnerability Management Life Cycle?

Helps in finding and remediating security weaknesses before they are exploited.
This includes defining the risk posture and policies for an organization,
creating a complete asset list of systems, scanning and assessing the environment
for vulnerabilities and exposures, and taking action to mitigate the
vulnerabilities that are found.


The phases involved in vulnerability management are:

	▪ Creating Baseline - critical assets are identified and prioritized.

	▪ Vulnerability Assessment - the security analyst identifies the known
	vulnerabilities in the organization infrastructure.

	▪ Risk Assessment - summarizes the vulnerability and risk level identified for
	each of the selected asset. It determines the risk level for a particular
	asset, whether it is high, moderate, or low.

	▪ Remediation - the process of reducing the severity of vulnerabilities.
NOTE: This phase is initiated after the successful implementation of baselining
and assessment steps.

	▪ Verification - allows the security team to check whether all the previous
	phases have been properly executed.

	▪ Monitor - Continuous monitoring identifies potential threats and any new
	vulnerabilities that may arise.


What is the Post-Assessment Phase?

Also known as the recommendation phase, it is performed after the risk assessment.
Post-assessment is based on the risk assessment.

Risk characterization is categorized by the key criteria, which helps to
prioritize the list of recommendations.

The tasks performed in the post-assessment phase include:

	▪ Making the priority list for assessment recommendations
	▪ Developing an action plan to implement the proposed recommendation
	▪ Capturing lessons learned to improve the complete process in the future 		
	▪ Conducting training for the employees


NOTE: Post-assessment includes risk assessment, remediation, verification, and
monitoring.


Steps for each phase:

Steps involved in creating a baseline:

	1. Identify and understand business processes
	2. Identify the applications, data, and services that support the business processes
	3. Create an inventory of all assets, and prioritize/rank the critical assets
	4. Map the network infrastructure
	5. Identify the controls already in place
	6. Understand policy implementation and standards compliance to the business processes
	7. Define the scope of the assessment
	8. Create information protection procedures to support effective planning, scheduling, coordination, and logistics


Steps involved in Vulnerability Assessment phase:

	1. Examine and evaluate physical security
	2. Check for misconfigurations and human errors
	3. Run vulnerability scans using tools
	4. Identify and prioritize vulnerabilities
	5. Apply business and technology context to scanner results
	6. Perform OSINT information gathering to validate the vulnerabilities
	7. Create a vulnerability scan report


The tasks performed in the risk assessment phase include:

	1. Perform risk characterization
	2. Assess the level of impact
	3. Determine the threat and risk level


The tasks performed in the remediation phase include:

	1. Prioritize recommendations
	2. Develop an action plan to implement the recommendation
	3. Perform root-cause analysis
	4. Apply patches/fixes
	5. Capture lessons learned
	6. Conduct awareness training


The tasks performed in the verification phase include:

	1. Perform dynamic analysis
	2. Attack surface review


The tasks performed in the monitoring phase include:

	1. Monitoring intrusion detection and intrusion prevention logs
	2. Implementation of policies, procedures, and controls
